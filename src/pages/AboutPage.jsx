      <p className="leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
        I am an independent AI & Security Consultant focused on practical system design, applied research, and technically sound
        implementation strategy.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
        My background includes applied AI systems, security tooling, and research-oriented engineering across product and
        infrastructure contexts. I work with teams that need direct technical reasoning, clear tradeoff analysis, and defensible
        execution paths.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
        A representative concept from this work is AgentShield, an autonomous kernel-level network defense concept aimed at
        improving runtime visibility, detection fidelity, and response discipline under real-world operational constraints.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
        Across engagements, I prioritize ethics, correctness, and engineering depth over speed-only delivery.
